**Welcome to my profile!**

![](https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/api/cards/profile-details?username=hogsy&theme=monokai)

I'm Mark Sowden, otherwise known as my alias 'hogsy' - based in the UK, England.
Working to preserve video game history through [TalonBrave.info](https://talonbrave.info/), [The Data Dungeon](https://thedatadungeon.com) and other initiatives, and developing my own games as [Quartermind Games](https://github.com/QuartermindGames).

Beyond that, reverse-engineering is another hobby of mine.
A few examples of which I've provided below.

- [Small Furry Creatures](https://talonbrave.info/?p=2690)
- [Triton’s HDV model format](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1334)
- [Exploring the deep, with Bullfrog’s Creation](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1563)
- [Dark Vengeance Extraction Utility](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1614)
