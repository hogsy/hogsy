<b>Welcome to my profile!</b>

I'm hogsy, aka Mark Sowden - based in the UK, England. Primarily working to preserve video game history through [TalonBrave.info](http://talonbrave.info/) and other initiatives.

These initiatives include open-source projects for the community such as [OpenHoW](https://github.com/TalonBraveInfo/OpenHoW), a reimplementation of the classic Hogs of War game that was originally released for PC and PSX, and [Invasion](https://github.com/TalonBraveInfo/Invasion), a recreation of Valve's cancelled Team Fortress 2 iteration from 2003.

Beyond that, I also do reverse-engineering for various games on the side and document my work. A few examples of which I've provided below.

- [The unseen animations of Into the Shadows](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1432)
- [Triton’s HDV model format](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1334)
- [Exploring the deep, with Bullfrog’s Creation](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1563)
- [Sentient Textures](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1902)
- [Dark Vengeance Extraction Utility](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1614)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat! I'm available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hogsy16), Discord (**hogsy#9210**) or via [email](mailto:hogsy@oldtimes-software.com).
