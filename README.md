**Welcome to my profile!**

![](https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/api/cards/profile-details?username=hogsy&theme=monokai)

I'm Mark Sowden, otherwise known as my alias 'hogsy' - based in the UK, England. I'm primarily working to preserve video game history through [TalonBrave.info](https://talonbrave.info/), [The Data Dungeon](https://thedatadungeon.com) and other initiatives. Also founder of a development group called [OldTimes Software](https://oldtimes-software.com/).

I've been involved in open-source projects for the community such as [OpenHoW](https://github.com/TalonBraveInfo/OpenHoW), a reimplementation of the classic Hogs of War game that was originally released for PC and PSX, and [Invasion](https://github.com/TalonBraveInfo/Invasion), a recreation of Valve's cancelled Team Fortress 2 iteration from 2003.

Beyond that, I also do reverse-engineering for various games on the side and document my work. A few examples of which I've provided below.

- [Small Furry Creatures](https://talonbrave.info/?p=2690)
- [Triton’s HDV model format](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1334)
- [Exploring the deep, with Bullfrog’s Creation](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1563)
- [Dark Vengeance Extraction Utility](http://talonbrave.info/?p=1614)
